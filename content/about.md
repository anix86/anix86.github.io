## About Me

Hi, I'm Aneesh Nair — a lifelong learner with 18+ years of experience in IT services and project management. I'm currently deep-diving into the world of Artificial Intelligence, exploring new tools and documenting everything as I go.

This site is my personal journal and resource for anyone else trying to keep up with the fast-moving AI and tech space. If you love discovering new tech, you're in the right place.
