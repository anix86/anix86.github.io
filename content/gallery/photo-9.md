Skógafoss in full summer flow, fed by snowmelt from the Eyjafjallajökull glacier above. The falls drop 60 metres straight into the river below and produce a permanent rainbow on sunny days. The mist reaches you 50 metres away and the sound is all-consuming. One of those places that photographs still can't quite capture.
