The Atacama plateau sits at over 5,000 metres with almost zero humidity and no light pollution for hundreds of kilometres in any direction — which makes it one of the best places on earth to see the Milky Way. This was a 25-second exposure. The core of the galaxy arches directly overhead; the Magellanic Clouds are visible to the south.
