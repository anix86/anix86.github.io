The dunes at White Sands are made of gypsum crystals, which means they stay remarkably cool even in summer — and they stay brilliantly white. Shot in the late afternoon when the low sun throws sharp shadows across each ripple and crest, turning the landscape into something closer to abstract sculpture than geography.
