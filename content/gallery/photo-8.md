Rolling fields of the Cotswolds photographed from a public footpath that winds between dry-stone walls and hedgerows. The light was soft after a morning shower, with the clouds still breaking apart. Villages here look unchanged for centuries — honey-coloured limestone, slate rooftops, church spires just visible over the tree line.
